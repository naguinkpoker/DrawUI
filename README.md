## Getting Started

This is a Next.js app. To get started run the following commands in the root directory of the project. You will need an OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-4 Vision API.

> Note this uses Next.js 14 and requires a version of `node` greater than 18.17. [Read more here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/version-14).

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```
